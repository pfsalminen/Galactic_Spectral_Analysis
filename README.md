# Galactic Spectral Analysis
##Paul Salminen

###About
This is a python program I wrote to find the Z value of galaxies. The data (included) was taken from SDSS, with the SQL script in this repo. The program exports a .csv file of all z values, and the each galaxy's average flux. The ipython notebook inluded is an analysis of the data I received. 

Written in Python 2.7.8

###More to come!
I hope to do some cool stuff with this data. Since I'm interested in it, I think I'm going to try some machine learning stuff with this. Maybe do some sci-kit learn clustering.
